# PokeBlocks
MVP For a Blockchain Collector Game 

First iteration based on [Simple Python Blockchain](https://github.com/howCodeORG/Simple-Python-Blockchain/blob/master/blockchain.py).

Players are able to join a world (construct) and start exploring (mining) for Pokemon (Blocks).
Each Pokemon comes with a specific level (which is a random drop between 5 levels from the player's current level) and the player level is calculated by the average of all Pokemon in the party. 
Difficulty scales according to the average global level of all players in a construct - it's much easier for a new player to scale upwards to the average, but the progression slows down once the average is reached.
New Pokemon are unlocked as player level goes up, but the loot pool includes all previously attained Pokemon.
